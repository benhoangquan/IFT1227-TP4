# MIPS Microprocessor Project

## Overview

This project is a deep dive into the design and implementation of a MIPS microprocessor, showcasing both single-cycle and multi-cycle versions. It's a comprehensive exploration of computer architecture, digital logic, and VHDL programming.

## Features

- **Single-Cycle MIPS Processor**: A straightforward design where each instruction is executed in one clock cycle, optimized for simplicity and clarity.
- **Multi-Cycle MIPS Processor**: An advanced version allowing instructions to be executed over multiple cycles, enhancing efficiency and speed for complex operations.
- **Custom Data Path Modifications**: Tailored modifications to the data path to accommodate specific MIPS instructions, enhancing the processor's versatility and performance.
- **Control Unit Design**: Detailed design of the control unit with a complete truth table for new instructions, ensuring precise control over the execution of instructions.
- **VHDL Implementations**: Full VHDL code for both processor versions, providing a hands-on look at hardware description and simulation.

## Key Learning

Working on this project really opened my eyes to how microarchitecture works. It's kinda wild to see how what we write in high-level code gets turned into machine code, and then watching that code run through the processor I helped design was just mind-blowing. It's like seeing the hidden magic behind the screen. This whole experience made me way more clued into how the lower-level stuff works, which I think is super important for squaring away my coding skills and making everything run smoother and faster.

## How to Use

Run this project using Intel Quartus - a FPGA design software.
